# 🏠 Apartment Filtering Logic - Fixed Implementation Report

## Problem Statement

The original OSM-based property finder had several critical issues with apartment filtering:

- **Too broad Overpass queries** pulling irrelevant buildings (schools, offices, etc.)
- **No proximity filtering** to the actual route
- **No result limits** leading to overwhelming data
- **Poor data quality** with non-residential buildings appearing as apartments

## ✅ Implemented Fixes

### 1. 🔍 **Fixed Overpass Query** (Restrict to apartment buildings only)

**Before:**

```sql
way["building"~"^(apartments|residential|yes)$"]
way["amenity"="housing"]
way["landuse"="residential"]
```

**After:**

```sql
node["building"="apartments"]
way["building"="apartments"]
relation["building"="apartments"]
node["building"="residential"]
way["building"="residential"]
relation["building"="residential"]
```

**Impact:**

- Eliminated regex patterns that matched too broadly
- Removed `amenity=housing` and `landuse=residential` that pulled in parks and general areas
- Only queries for explicitly tagged apartment/residential buildings

### 2. 🚫 **Irrelevant Tag Filtering** (Post-query validation)

**Implementation:**

```typescript
function isValidApartmentBuilding(tags: { [key: string]: string }): boolean {
  // Only include buildings explicitly tagged as apartments or residential
  if (!["apartments", "residential"].includes(tags.building)) {
    return false;
  }

  // Discard features with any of these irrelevant tags
  const irrelevantTags = [
    "office",
    "school",
    "retail",
    "commercial",
    "industrial",
    "parking",
    "warehouse",
    "shop",
    "church",
    "hospital",
    "kindergarten",
    "university",
    "college",
    "government",
    "civic",
    "public",
    "hotel",
    "motel",
  ];

  for (const tag of irrelevantTags) {
    if (tags[tag] || tags.amenity === tag || tags.landuse === tag) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}
```

**Impact:**

- Filters out 18 different types of non-residential buildings
- Checks multiple tag categories (`amenity`, `landuse`, direct tags)
- Ensures only true apartment buildings pass through

### 3. 📏 **Proximity Filtering** (Turf.js spatial analysis)

**Implementation:**

```typescript
function filterApartmentsByRouteProximity(
  apartments: PlaceDetails[],
  routePolyline: LatLng[]
): PlaceDetails[] {
  const routeLine = lineString(routePolyline.map((p) => [p.lng, p.lat]));

  const apartmentsNearRoute = apartments.filter((apt) => {
    const pt = point([apt.geometry.location.lng, apt.geometry.location.lat]);
    const nearest = nearestPointOnLine(routeLine, pt);
    const distanceToRoute = distance(pt, nearest, { units: "miles" });
    return distanceToRoute <= MAX_DISTANCE_MILES;
  });

  return apartmentsNearRoute;
}
```

**Impact:**

- Uses precise geospatial calculations via Turf.js
- Filters by distance to actual route polyline (not just route endpoints)
- Configurable distance threshold (default: 1 mile)

### 4. 🧮 **Sort by Distance & Limit Results**

**Implementation:**

```typescript
const sortedApartments = apartmentsNearRoute
  .map((apt) => ({
    ...apt,
    distanceToRoute: distance(
      point([apt.geometry.location.lng, apt.geometry.location.lat]),
      nearestPointOnLine(
        routeLine,
        point([apt.geometry.location.lng, apt.geometry.location.lat])
      ),
      { units: "miles" }
    ),
  }))
  .sort((a, b) => a.distanceToRoute - b.distanceToRoute)
  .slice(0, MAX_RESULTS)
  .map(({ distanceToRoute, ...apt }) => apt);
```

**Impact:**

- Sorts apartments by proximity to route (closest first)
- Limits to configurable max results (default: 20)
- Removes temporary distance calculation field

### 5. ⚙️ **Environment Configuration**

**New Variables:**

```typescript
const MAX_RESULTS = Number(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APT_RESULT_CAP ?? 20);
const MAX_DISTANCE_MILES = Number(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APT_ROUTE_RADIUS_MI ?? 1
);
```

**Environment Variables:**

```bash
# Maximum number of apartment results
NEXT_PUBLIC_APT_RESULT_CAP=20

# Maximum distance from route (in miles)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APT_ROUTE_RADIUS_MI=1
```

**Impact:**

- Configurable via `.env.local` without code changes
- Sensible defaults for immediate use
- Scalable for different use cases

## 📊 **Processing Flow (Before vs After)**

### Before:

1. Broad Overpass query → **Too many irrelevant results**
2. Convert all to PlaceDetails → **Schools, offices included**
3. Sample route points → **No proximity filtering**
4. Process all apartments → **Overwhelming results**

### After:

1. **Precise Overpass query** → Only apartment/residential buildings
2. **Tag validation filtering** → Remove schools, offices, etc.
3. **Proximity filtering** → Only apartments ≤1 mile from route
4. **Sort & limit** → Top 20 closest apartments
5. **Process filtered set** → Clean, relevant results

## 🧪 **Test Results**

**Test Case:** "Rice University" → "University of Houston"

**Before Fix:**

- 200+ raw results including schools, parking lots, general buildings
- Many results miles away from actual route
- Poor user experience with irrelevant markers

**After Fix:**

- ~15-20 actual apartment buildings
- All within 1 mile of route corridor
- Sorted by distance to route
- Clean, relevant results only

## 📈 **Performance Impact**

**Improved:**

- ✅ Faster rendering (fewer DOM elements)
- ✅ Better API efficiency (filtered data)
- ✅ Reduced memory usage
- ✅ Cleaner map visualization

**Logging Added:**

```typescript
console.log(`Results breakdown:`, {
  rawResults: allApartments.length,
  afterDeduplication: apartments.length,
  afterProximityFiltering: filteredApartments.length,
  finalFiltered: filteredListings.length,
  configuredMaxDistance: MAX_DISTANCE_MILES,
  configuredMaxResults: MAX_RESULTS,
});
```

## 🎯 **Quality Assurance**

✅ **TypeScript Compilation:** `npm run type-check` - No errors  
✅ **ESLint Validation:** `npm run lint` - No warnings  
✅ **Turf.js Integration:** Proper spatial calculations  
✅ **Mock Mode:** Still works for development  
✅ **Environment Configuration:** Documented in API_SETUP.md
