## 📝 API Documentation

### Environment Variables

| Variable                          | Required | Description                     |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | Yes      | Client-side Google Maps API key |
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`             | Yes      | Server-side Google Maps API key |

### Google Maps API Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing
3. Enable required APIs:
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Places API
   - Directions API
   - Distance Matrix API
4. Create credentials (API Key)
5. Set up billing (required for Google Maps APIs)

## 🔒 Security

- **API Keys Protection**: All API keys are stored in environment variables and excluded from version control
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented caching to reduce API calls
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized

## ⚡ Performance

### Performance Targets (v2.0)

| Metric                      | Target              | Implementation                              |
| --------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **p95 Response Time**       | ≤ 2s                | Search-Along-Route (SAR) primary path       |
| **Google Places API Calls** | ≤ 70 per request    | Adaptive sampler with early termination     |
| **Places SAR Usage**        | 100% when available | Primary path with fallback to nearby search |
| **Memory Usage**            | ≤ 200MB @ 50 users  | LRU caching with TTL expiration             |
| **Recall Consistency**      | ±2 properties vs v1 | Geo-hash deduplication maintains quality    |

### Architecture Optimizations

- **🎯 SAR-First Strategy**: Places Search-Along-Route as primary method
- **⚡ Adaptive Sampling**: Every 3rd polyline vertex (~100m intervals)
- **🔄 Concurrent Processing**: p-limit with 10 concurrent requests max
- **📦 Batched Place Details**: Lazy-loaded via `/api/placeDetails?id=...`
- **🗂️ Geo-hash Deduplication**: 8-char precision for near-identical filtering
- **💾 Multi-tier LRU Caching**:
  - SAR responses (10 min TTL)
  - Nearby search pages (10 min TTL)
  - Place details (30 min TTL)
- **📈 Request Shaping**: Exponential backoff with jitter on rate limits
- **📊 Performance Metrics**: Prometheus metrics with latency histograms

### Performance Features

- **Caching**: Multi-layer LRU caching with TTL for routes and apartment data
- **Optimized Rendering**: Efficient React rendering with proper memoization
- **Code Splitting**: Next.js automatic code splitting for faster loading
- **Lazy Loading**: Place details fetched on-demand in gallery view
- **Quota Management**: Intelligent SAR quota tracking with fallback paths

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Maps not loading**

- Verify your Google Maps API key is correct
- Ensure all required APIs are enabled
- Check browser console for error messages

**Search not working**

- Confirm Places API is enabled
- Verify API key has proper permissions
- Check network connectivity

**No apartments found**

- Try different routes or locations
- Check if the area has apartment listings
- Verify API quotas haven't been exceeded
